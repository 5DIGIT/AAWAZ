# Aawaz Android

This is the Android component of our project, which was developed using XML and Java programming languages.

The application facilitates user authentication for login and registration purposes, allowing them to report any issues in their vicinity by taking a photo and submitting it to the server with a single click. The server is equipped with a machine learning model that evaluates the submitted content to determine if it is spam. If the content is deemed non-spam, it is forwarded to the relevant authorities for further action.

The application comprises several components, including a login screen, location screen, registration window, and the primary capture intent. The location screen is included to demonstrate how the application can access a user's live location and transmit it to the server along with the captured image, enabling the machine learning model to provide relevant information to the appropriate authorities for assistance.

The login page will authenticate user with phone OTP but for now it has been made static intentionaly for simplicity. It will be updated in future updates.



# Example
A user posting a valid complain photo request from Gomti Nagar Extension Lucknow having pincode 226010 will be informed to Makdurpur Chauki for further help.

# Alternate Download
You can download the apk file and run the application from the apk  file uploaded in this section.

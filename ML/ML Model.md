ML Model

The train.py file trains three separate models (one is demonstrated). Each model is trained using the sklearn Linear Model Perceptron algorithm. Datasets taken from kaggle were used to create the model. preprocessing.py takes in images and formats them in a way that the trainer and model can read it properly

test.py is used to test model accuracy.

This server code is just a proof of concept showing that an API can be developed for the ERSS system, which 
can be easily linked to our main server.

The main reason why we need to be a part of the ERSS system is so that we can provide the fastest possible response to any sort of emergency.
To do this, we need to get permission from each state government and, along with them, implement a version of the following system. 

Currently this flask app just recieves the image of the accident site along with the exact location of the site.
This information can now be directly used by the state ERSS to mitigate the emergency situation.
